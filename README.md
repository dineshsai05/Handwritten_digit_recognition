# Handwritten Digits Recognition

This project implements a simple machine learning model using TensorFlow's Sequential Neural Network to identify handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset.

## How to Run

1. **Prepare the Model:**
   - Run the code blocks in `handwritten_digit_model.ipynb` one by one. This will create and save the model for later use.

2. **Live Demo:**
   - Run the live demo script using the following command:
     ```bash
     python ./live_demo.py ./name_of_your_model.h5
     ```
   - Replace `name_of_your_model.h5` with the name of your saved model file.

## Requirements

- TensorFlow
- Pygame
